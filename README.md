# Blue-Green Deployment in a Local Environment with Docker

## Introduction

Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy designed to minimize downtime and risks during application updates. This approach involves running two separate environments, Blue and Green, where one serves traffic (the active environment) while the other is idle or undergoing updates. Once the updates are validated in the idle environment, traffic is switched seamlessly, ensuring stability and minimizing disruptions.

In this guide, we demonstrate how to implement Blue-Green Deployment using Docker in a local environment with Laravel as the example application. This approach is tailored for educational purposes, offering a hands-on way to grasp the fundamentals of Blue-Green Deployment.

## Why Docker for Blue-Green Deployment?

Docker provides an efficient way to isolate and simulate environments for Blue-Green Deployment in a local setup. Using Docker containers, you can create independent "Blue" and "Green" environments, test changes safely, and switch traffic between them.

This guide leverages Docker to:
- Simulate real-world deployment behavior.
- Visualize the Blue-Green Deployment process in an accessible way.
- Replicate health checks and traffic routing, similar to setups on platforms like AWS ECS or Kubernetes.

While there are other ways to test deployments locally, this method focuses on simplicity and clarity, allowing developers to understand the strategy without the complexity of managing cloud infrastructure.

## Why Test Locally?

Testing Blue-Green Deployment locally provides several benefits:
- Safe debugging: Identify issues in deployment scripts without impacting production.
- Replicating production workflows: Validate environment transitions, API integrations, and scheduled tasks.
- Downtime-free testing: Switch traffic seamlessly between containers, ensuring smooth user experiences.
- Hands-on learning: Gain a deep understanding of deployment strategies by observing their effects in real-time.

This local setup enables you to confidently refine deployment strategies before scaling them to production environments.

## Demonstration Setup

For this demonstration, the following components are used:
1. Nginx: Acts as the reverse proxy to route traffic to the active environment.
2. Health checks: Monitor container readiness and decide when to switch traffic.
3. Laravel: Example application to visualize environment transitions.

## The Vital Role of Health Checks in Blue-Green Deployment

One of the key components of this setup is the use of health checks. These checks continuously monitor the status of a container to determine if it is ready to handle traffic. Health checks are essential in Blue-Green Deployment, as they ensure stability and minimize risks during the transition between environments.

In this local setup, health checks play the following roles:
	1.	Simulating production behavior: Platforms like AWS ECS and Kubernetes rely heavily on health checks to determine if a service is operational. By defining health checks in our docker-compose.yml file, we replicate this behavior in a local environment, providing a close-to-real-world experience.
	2.	Automating deployment decisions: The deployment script uses health checks to decide whether traffic can be routed to the new environment. If a container fails its health checks, the script avoids switching traffic and triggers a rollback to maintain application availability.
	3.	Ensuring application readiness: Before switching traffic to a new environment, health checks validate that the new container is fully operational. This prevents downtime caused by incomplete deployments or application errors.

## Health Check Configuration

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 5s
```

- test: Runs a command to check if the container is responding. In this case, it sends an HTTP request to the application and expects a successful response.
- interval: Sets the frequency of health check execution.
- timeout: Defines how long the health check can take before it‚Äôs considered a failure.
- retries: Specifies the number of consecutive failures before the container is marked as unhealthy.
- start_period: Allows a grace period for the container to fully initialize before health checks start.

## Visual Representation of Blue-Green Deployment

Here‚Äôs a simplified diagram of the Blue-Green Deployment process:

+-------------------+                   +--------------------+
```

## Why Health Checks Are Critical

Health checks are the backbone of this Blue-Green Deployment strategy because they:
- Prevent downtime: Only containers that pass health checks receive traffic, ensuring users are always directed to a functional environment.
- Enable automated rollbacks: If a container fails its health checks, the script reverts to the previously active environment.
- Promote confidence: By validating the readiness of the new environment, health checks reduce the risk of deploying faulty updates.

```


2. Nginx Configuration: Handles traffic routing to the active environment.

`nginx/default.conf`
```ini
server {
    listen 80;
    index index.php index.html;
    client_max_body_size 20M;
    root /var/www/html/public;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass app_backend;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

3. PHP-FPM Configuration: Manages PHP processes for Laravel.

`php/www.conf`
```ini
listen = 9000
user = www-data
group = www-data

[www]
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 20
pm.start_servers = 10
pm.min_spare_servers = 5
pm.max_spare_servers = 15
```

4. Dockerfile: Sets up the Laravel environment with required dependencies.

`Dockerfile`
```Dockerfile
FROM php:8.2.0-fpm
WORKDIR /var/www/html
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    dos2unix \
    git \
    libonig-dev \
    libpng-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    libzip-dev \
    unzip \
    zip \
    libfcgi0ldbl \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql mbstring exif pcntl bcmath gd zip \
    && curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer \
    && mkdir -p /var/www/html/storage /var/www/html/bootstrap/cache && \
    chown -R :www-data ./bootstrap/cache && \
    mkdir -p storage && \
    cd storage/ && \
    mkdir -p logs && \
    mkdir -p app && \
    mkdir -p framework/sessions && \
    mkdir -p framework/views && \
    mkdir -p framework/cache && \
    chmod -R 775 framework logs app && \
    chown -R :www-data ./framework ./logs ./app && \
    git config --global --add safe.directory '*'

COPY ./scripts/start.sh /usr/local/bin/start.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/start.sh
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/start.sh"]
```

5. Docker Compose: Defines the Blue-Green containers, Nginx, and health check configurations.

`docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  blue:
    container_name: blue
    env_file:
      - .env
    profiles:
      - blue
    build:
      context: ./docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
      - ./docker/supervisor/supervisord.conf:/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf
      - ./docker/php/www.conf:/usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "SCRIPT_FILENAME=/var/www/html/public/index.php REQUEST_METHOD=GET cgi-fcgi -bind -connect 127.0.0.1:9000 || exit 1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 5s

  green:
    container_name: green
    profiles:
      - green
    env_file:
      - .env
    build:
      context: ./docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
      - ./docker/supervisor/supervisord.conf:/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf
      - ./docker/php/www.conf:/usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "SCRIPT_FILENAME=/var/www/html/public/index.php REQUEST_METHOD=GET cgi-fcgi -bind -connect 127.0.0.1:9000 || exit 1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 5s

  app:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: app
    profiles:
      - blue
      - green
    ports:
      - "${PORT-80}:80"
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
      - ./docker/nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 5s
```

## Health Checks in Action

####  How It Works
1. When deploying updates:
    - A new environment (Blue or Green) is started.
	- Health checks validate the container‚Äôs readiness.
2. If health checks pass:
	- Traffic is routed to the new environment.
	- The old environment becomes idle, ready for future updates.
3. If health checks fail:
	- A rollback is triggered, and the active environment remains unchanged.

#### Automated Rollback Example

The deployment script ensures a rollback occurs when health checks fail. For example:
- Blue is active, and Green fails health checks.
- Traffic remains routed to Blue.
- The faulty Green container is removed, preserving application stability.

#### Examples:
- [üé• Deployment demo](https://youtu.be/SKwZpRnhCkY): Visualizes the transition from Blue to Green.
- [üé• Rollback demo](https://youtu.be/FZ9T3LmXBYs): Demonstrates how rollbacks maintain stability when an update fails.


## Conclusion
This guide demonstrates how to simulate and understand Blue-Green Deployment using Docker in a local environment. By leveraging health checks, traffic switching, and automated rollbacks, you can minimize downtime and ensure stability during deployments. While this approach is simplified, the concepts can easily extend to production-grade systems.

Use this setup to test and refine deployment strategies confidently before scaling to production.
